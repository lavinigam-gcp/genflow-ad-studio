Analyze the product image provided and create a cinematic {target_duration}-second \

SPECIFICATIONS: {specs}

CREATIVE DIRECTION: {ad_tone}

NARRATIVE ARC ({scene_count} scenes, ~{target_duration} seconds total):
{narrative_arc}

VEO 3.1 CONSISTENCY RULES (follow exactly):
- Write ONE 'detailed_avatar_description' string — a comprehensive physical \
description of the avatar (height, build, skin tone, hair color/style, eye color, \
facial features, clothing, accessories). Copy this IDENTICAL string into EVERY \
scene's 'detailed_avatar_description' field. This is how Veo maintains character \
consistency across clips.
- Write a 'voice_style' string describing the avatar's voice (timbre, accent, \
pacing, pitch range). Set it at the top level AND in every scene.
- Write 'negative_elements' listing things to AVOID. Set globally AND per-scene.

DIALOGUE RULES:
- Max {max_words} words per scene
- Use colon notation: 'The subject speaks: Buy now.' — NEVER use quotation marks \
around dialogue (Veo renders them as on-screen text)
- Conversational, punchy, direct-to-camera tone
- Use power words: finally, imagine, discover, unlock
- End with a single clear CTA

SCENE CONTINUITY RULES:
- The ending frame of scene N must visually match the opening frame of scene N+1.
- Maintain consistent color grading and lighting temperature across all scenes.
- When camera position changes between scenes, use match cuts or motivated \
transitions to preserve spatial logic.
- Ensure the avatar's wardrobe, hairstyle, and accessories remain identical \
throughout all scenes.
